To use this server you need to go into console and navigate to the file containing the server. Next, run the command to compile the JHTTP and RequestProccessor files by writing:
javac RequestProcessor.java JHTTP.java
next to run the files you need to specify a port (I'll be using 8080 as an example) to run the server on and run JHTTP:
C:\Users\decla\documents\github\CSE389-Web-Server 8080
Now all you have to go onto a webrowser and type in local host and your port number:
localhost:8080
To use the server admin UI
